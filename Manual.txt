TCP Tic-Tac-Toe Game

How to join a server:
1) Run the TicTacToeServer.java file in your preferred IDE.

2) Once it is running, run the TicTacToeClient.java file, with the host IP address as a command line argument, in your 
preferred IDE (note: this must be done in a different project than the TicTacToeServer.java file). On

3) Once the Client code is running, you will be connected to the server, and automatically assigned X or O, depending on 
if you are the first or second person to join the room. In addition, a new window will appear, showing the current board
state. If you are the first person, it will state that it is waiting for an opponent to connect.

4) Once another client joins, the game will begin, starting with the player assigned X.

How to play:
1) Left-click on an unmarked space to place your letter.

2) If a space is marked, you will be prompted that the cell is already occupied.

3) If you left-click while it is not your turn, it will prompt you that it is not your turn.

4) When a move is valid, you will get a confirmation, and play will pass to your opponent (note: your opponent will 
also receive a prompt stating it is their turn).

5) Continue to play until a winner is determined or a scratched game occurs.

Disconnecting from a server:
Method 1: In-progress
1) After connecting to the server, click the X in the top right corner to close your instance of the game.

2) If you are connected to another player and do this, you will be prompted that your opponent has disconnected. Upon
clicking the confirmation, you will then be disconnected from the server.


Method 2: Completing the game
1) If a player matches their letter in a row, column or diagonal, the winning player will be given a prompt stating they have
won (the opposing player will recieve a message that they lost).

2) Upon clicking the confirmation, the player will be disconnected from the server.
